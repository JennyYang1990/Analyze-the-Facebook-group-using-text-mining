Abstract: Gamification has the potential to increases learning motivation and engagement. 
Due to such advantages, this technique has attracted different roles of people, such as teachers, instructional designers, educational systems designers, or even company training employees to learn, share, and discuss on the internet. 
Previous studies investigated one group of people's views about gamification via traditional methods, like interviews or surveys. 
We used text mining to interpret Facebook gamification groups' discussions. We analyzed the user profile descriptions to determine who were active participators in two Facebook gamification groups. 
We also examined the posts' content that gets the most "like" and "comment" and conducted a topic modeling analysis to find the themes. 
Our findings provide diverse views of gamification to researchers and practitioners and could support future development of gamification in new aspects.
